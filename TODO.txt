- 3x3x3 test case is failing due to invalid parity
    Figure out which edge to flip to create valid parity
    This is done but do the same for 5x5x5 and 7x7x7 (midges vs corners)

- 6x6x6 test case is failing because we get two high wings of the same color

- Current takes 4s to run all test cases...how fast if we do not contrast stretch?
    Takes 3s.  If we can get all test cases passing without the contrast stretch
    we could comment out that part.
