- The SPIKE color sensor appears to be really good. Create a lightweight class
that only has the following:

    self.sanity_check_edge_squares()
    self.validate_all_corners_found()
    self.validate_odd_cube_midge_vs_corner_parity()

We can use that to validate the colors returned from the SPIKE color sensor.
This will save us some much needed memory and CPU cycles on SPIKE.

Create some test cases for this where you feed it a kociemba string and it
validates that the cube is legit.

- Combine the fh.write() calls into a single call
