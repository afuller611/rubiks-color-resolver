- 3x3x3 test case is failing due to invalid parity
    Figure out which edge to flip to create valid parity

- 6x6x6 test case is failing because we get two high wings of the same color

- 7x7x7 needs orbit pairs stuff


- Current takes 4s to run all test cases...how fast if we do not white balance?
    Takes 3s.  If we can get all test cases passing without the white balancing
    we could comment out that part.
